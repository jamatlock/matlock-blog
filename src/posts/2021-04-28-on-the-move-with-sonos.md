# Disclaimer

I am a SONOS fanboy. I own several SONOS speakers and a Connect all of which I have paid handsomely for whether they have been used or new from various vendors. I used to be a Bose guy. As a matter of fact I'm listening to my SoundLink while I'm writing this but only because I'm in a hotel room in San Francisco and the Bose travels well. Do I see a SONOS Roam in my future? I tried to make my AcoustiMass and the AV receiver I used to drive it work as part of the whole house audio system using the Connect. But I finally succumbed to the lure of the SONOS Playbase's simplicity and my wife's longing for fewer wires and no ceiling mounted speakers. It's not 5.1 but it sounds pretty damn good and my wife doesn't have to futz with multiple devices and their respective remotes or one complicated universal one.

I love walking from room to room (and even the garage) hearing my Spotify playlist without interruption. Stupid as it sounds, if I go out to the garage for a few minutes and I come back in to find I've missed most of my favorite songs I feel cheated. The song is on the playlist and I want to hear it, dammit! SONOS speakers won't blow the roof off but I'm too old for that anyway. And having speakers throughout the house allows me to keep them at a volume that's comfortable to my middle aged sensibilities.

In any case, you get the idea. That said, as much as I love SONOS products, the Move is the device that compelled me to finally start this blog. I like it that much.

# Price

I love music but I am not what you would consider an audiophile. I'm more interested in getting a lot of bang for my buck when it comes to buying audio equipment so I'm compelled to start with price. At $399, the Move feels outside of my comfort zone for a portable speaker. However, when a $100 dollar discount was offered at a major online retailer I jumped on it. I'm not sure $299 was in that comfort zone either but I fell for the sale tactic, "I can't afford not to!" My wife gave her approval because she would rather I spend more on a product, like SONOS, that I truly enjoy, rather than saving a few bucks and ending up disappointed. While it has a few glitches, the SONOS experience is nearly seamless and that makes it worth a bit of what I consider a premium price tag.

# Style

It looks great. The charging base is low profile and the cord is even svelte. The Move's vertical footprint and less obtrusive power cord make it a vast visual improvement over the Play 3 it replaced. The neutral white color fits nicely with our minimalist-lite tendencies and blends in nicely on our stark white countertops.

# Features

## Durability

I have an aversion to exposing $400 electronic devices to the elements or dropping them for that matter. The Move does have a certain amount of heft to it however. One that suggests quality like a car door that closes with that authority. For all I know there's sand in the base but I suspect there's a serious magnet in there somewhere.

## User Experience

As mentioned before, ease of use and convivence is a huge selling point to me. The touch controls on the top are consistent with other SONOS devices. Whether intuitive or merely familiar they work for me and even the more technically challenged in the household. 

# Performance

## Sound

## Battery

I don't ride the speaker hard so I can't speak claims of 11 hour battery life. What I can say is it has never died on me. Typical battery only use cases for me are leaving it off the charging base for a few days for periodic use and outdoor dinner parties that go on for several hours. 

## Pro Tip

The Move's main home is in my kitchen. I typically keep it under a wall cabinet where it resonates more and the bass has more punch. I'm considering building a plywood box to place the speaker in when it's outside to see if the same effect can be achieved. If so I can stylize the box to make it presentable when guests are over.

# Overall Thoughts

I dream of getting another one and setting them up for stereo
